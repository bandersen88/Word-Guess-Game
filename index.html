<!-- What do I need to be able to do here...
    - If a key is pressed, compare that key to the array
    of all previous keys press.
        If it's been pressed before, do nothing
        If it hasn't been pressed before, compare it to the
        array of characters in the guess word.
        If it is one of the words in the guess word, show it
        on the screen in the correct spot.
